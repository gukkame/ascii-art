Objectives//////////////////
Ascii-art is a program which consists in receiving a string as an argument and outputting the string in a graphic representation using ASCII. Time to write big.

What we mean by a graphic representation using ASCII, is to write the string received using ASCII characters, as you can see in the example below:

This project should handle an input with numbers, letters, spaces, special characters and \n.


Instructions //////////////////
Your project must be written in Go.

The code must respect the good practices.

It is recommended that the code present a test file.

Some banner files with a specific graphical template representation using ASCII will be given. The files are formatted in a way that is not necessary to change them.

Banner Format////////////////////
Each character has a height of 8 lines.
Characters are separated by a new line \n.
Here is an example  :

student$ go run . "Hello\n" | cat -e
 _    _          _   _          $
| |  | |        | | | |         $
| |__| |   ___  | | | |   ___   $
|  __  |  / _ \ | | | |  / _ \  $
| |  | | |  __/ | | | | | (_) | $
|_|  |_|  \___| |_| |_|  \___/  $
                                $
                                $
